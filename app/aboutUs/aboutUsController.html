			<p>We have instructors leading kids through obstacle skill development, and then run them through an actual obstacle course. We've built a progression path for the kids through a "belt system" (just like martial arts) to continually advance themselves and their skills. The NinjaFit Kids program has been a big hit and many kids are well on their way to becoming future American Ninja Warriors!! (Ages 5 & up)</p>
