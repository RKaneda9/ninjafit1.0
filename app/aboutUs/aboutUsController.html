			<p>What is 'functional fitness'? Bending, lifting, carrying, climbing... are all everyday physical activities that we take for granted until the effects of weight gain, poor posture, and/or a sedentary lifestyle can make them difficult, even painful. Functional fitness trains your body so that it can perform these activities safely, easily and without pain. At NinjaFit Gym, our boot camp style functional fitness classes are designed to get you in shape head to toe, burning calories, building strength, increasing your flexibility, and improving your cardiovascular performance, all while having fun in the process. We incorporate free weights, kettlebells, ropes, medicine balls, balance boards, TRX equipment, plyometric/bodyweight exercises, box jumps, squat rags, pull up rigs, plyo boxes, rowers, stationary bikes, an aerodyne machine, and more to create a workout experience that will get you fit for LIFE!</p>
